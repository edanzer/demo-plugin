# Demo Plugin

This is a demo or resource plugin that I use when building other plugins. 

It is based on my plugin-boilerplate, but adds a range of solutoins for common plugin tasks - blocks, admin pages, cron jobs, etc. When working on another project, I can come to this plugin and grab relevant code snippets to accelerate development.
